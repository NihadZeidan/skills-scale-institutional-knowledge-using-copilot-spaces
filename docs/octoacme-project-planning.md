# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (PM, PdM, BA collaboration)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) - Developer-led with team input
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) - QA Lead ensures quality criteria included
5. Identify dependencies and integration points - PM coordinates
6. Create release plan and milestone map - PM accountable, team input
7. Design review and approval - UX/UI Designer presents, stakeholders approve

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner (Developer):
- Reviewer (QA Lead for quality, UX/UI Designer for UI features):
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
