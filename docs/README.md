# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub! Whether you're a new team member getting oriented or a seasoned contributor looking for a specific process, you'll find everything you need here. These guides are designed to make our complex efforts more repeatable, transparent, and accessible to everyone on the team.

## How We Manage Projects at OctoAcme

OctoAcme follows a structured five-phase project lifecycle that emphasizes iterative delivery, customer focus, and continuous improvement. Every project moves through **Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Close & Retrospective** phases, with clear decision gates and artifacts at each stage. Our approach begins with a lightweight Project One-pager that captures the problem statement, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment, then evolves into detailed backlogs, sprint plans, and release schedules as work progresses.

Throughout delivery, we maintain regular communication cadences including daily standups for delivery teams, weekly syncs between Project Managers and Product Managers, and monthly stakeholder updates. Our core roles work collaboratively: **Project Managers** coordinate schedules, risks, and communications; **Product Managers** define outcomes and prioritize work based on customer value; **Developers** build and test features; **QA Lead** validates quality and manages test strategy; **Agile Coach** facilitates ceremonies and coaches agile practices; **Business Analyst** elicits requirements and bridges stakeholder-development communication; **UX/UI Designer** creates user experiences aligned with user needs; and **Stakeholders** provide input and approvals. This clear ownership model ensures accountability while fostering psychological safety where everyone can contribute ideas and raise concerns.

Quality and risk management are embedded throughout our process. We enforce rigorous quality gates including unit tests, integration tests, and security scanning in CI pipelines, with pull request reviews required before merging. Our Risk Register tracks potential issues by impact and likelihood, with defined escalation paths from team-level triage to sponsor involvement for business-critical blockers. Every release follows a standardized deployment checklist with rollback plans, and each project concludes with a retrospective that converts learnings into actionable improvements tracked in our backlog.

Our work is guided by core principles: **customer-first thinking** drives prioritization decisions, **iterative delivery** enables us to ship small testable increments frequently, **data-informed decisions** ensure we measure impact and adapt based on evidence, and **psychological safety** creates an environment where feedback and learning are encouraged. These principles, combined with our structured processes, enable teams to deliver predictable outcomes while maintaining the flexibility to respond to changing needs.
